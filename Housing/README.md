# Rough PCB Model
You can use the [circuit board](housing/SmartMeter.SLDASM) design file to design custom enclosures for the PCBs.

We encourage you to use the off-the-shelf case which can be found at [here](https://www.voelkner.de/products/694730/Weltron-MR9-C-FA-RAL7035-ABS-Hutschienen-Gehaeuse-157.5-x-90-x-68-ABS-Lichtgrau-RAL-7035-1St..html) as you are working with 230V.
The PCBs were specially designed for this case and perfectly match into its mounting holes. The case offers a secure encapsulation, provides enough room and is rather inexpensive.

As the PCBs are designed in Eagle, the corresponding 3D models can also be imported directly in Fusion360.
